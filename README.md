# MetaWidgetSchema
Zero‑code, schema‑driven form renderer. Upload a JSON schema and the UI is generated at runtime: a root form for scalar/object fields and separate dynamic list sections for every root‑level array (add/remove rows). All data stays client‑side, can be saved to localStorage, and exported as a schema‑projected JSON (no extra fields).
